## Feedback or Issues?

If you have any issues or see something that looks off, feel free to take a screenshot and open an issue on github.

I've tailored this for a few specific languages:

-   Typescript / Javascript
-   Elixir
-   Svelte
-   Solidity

Languages not listed here could have highlighting ugliness (which I'll address if you open an issue!)

## Customization

Override with your own language specifc styling in your `settings.json` for personalization
